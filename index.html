            Hi, I'm Lee and I'm very excited to be starting my journey as a software developer. I've always been interested in technology and how its continuing advancement shapes our world. My 3 week course with Code Nation has been a really positive experience, getting to grips with Python and HTML/CSS was both challenging and rewarding. The greatest thing I've taken from the experience however is that it has opened my eyes to a whole new world of opportunities. Opportunities to further my own learning and to jump-start a new career in this fascinating and ever more relevant industry. I'm passionate about gaming, I'm very interested in where VR/AR is going, in particular if it will get integrated in a metaverse, and what that will mean for human interaction. Exciting times! I'm an avid reader, all things SciFi and fantasy, at the moment though I can't get enough of books that explore where technology is taking us, like Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow by Yuval Noah Harari. Thanks for taking the time to inquire about me, feel free to contact me for any more information. I genuinely look to forward hearing from you.
